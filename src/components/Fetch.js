        <p>Congrats you hacked the System. ü•∑</p>
        <p>
          By using "callBack function", you manipulated the trainTravelPlan to
          wait until the bus arrives.
        </p>
        <p>
          and that simply happens by calling "trainTravelPlan func" inside the
          "busTravelPlan func". ‚ôªÔ∏è
        </p>
        <p>
          and because javascript is a single Threading language so it needs to
          finish "busTravelPlan func" and then start with "trainTravelPlan func"
        </p>
        <p>
          But we have a new problem, Now all trains must wait til the bus
          arrives And that is the problem of synchronous programming.‚è±Ô∏è
        </p>
        <p>Click on the bus to start! ü§è</p>
